About the project:

This project was made by Avner Huri and Meni Ahdoot as a final project for
the course Digital Humanities by Yael Netzer at Ben-Gurion University.

The project goal was to compare between a song
lyrics and his youtube comments (by sentiment anlasis),
and dividing the song into genres and showing all the 
data on a scatter graph (see output_exmpel) 

Our conclusions from this project is that reggae 
music tends to be sad but with positive review, 
genres like pop rock and metal tends to correlate 
between the song lyrics and his comments. 
and in jazz there wasn't a distinct patterns.
